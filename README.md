# Shell Scripting Tutorial: Variables

Welcome to the Shell Scripting workspace! This repository is designed for anyone who wants to learn about variables in shell scripting, with clear examples and step-by-step instructions.

## Folder Structure
Each file demonstrates a specific concept related to shell script variables:

- `01.HelloWorld.sh`: Basic Hello World script
- `02.Variables.sh`: Introduction to variables
- `03.Global_Variable.sh`: Global variables
- `04.Local_Variable.sh`: Local variables
- `05.Env_Variable.sh`: Environment variables
- `06.Read_Only.sh`: Read-only variables
- `07.Special_Variable.sh`: Special variables
- `08.Read_Command.sh`: Using the `read` command

## How to Use
1. **Open each script** in your terminal or editor.
2. **Read the comments** in each file for explanations.
3. **Run the scripts** using:
   ```sh
   bash <script_name.sh>
   ```
   Replace `<script_name.sh>` with the file you want to execute.

## Learning Path
1. Start with `01.HelloWorld.sh` to understand basic script structure.
2. Move to `02.Variables.sh` for variable basics.
3. Explore global, local, and environment variables in scripts 3-5.
4. Learn about read-only and special variables in scripts 6-7.
5. Practice user input with `08.Read_Command.sh`.

## Tips
- Make scripts executable with `chmod +x <script_name.sh>`.
- Use `echo` to print variable values and debug.
- Experiment by modifying scripts and observing the output.

## Requirements
- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL/Git Bash)
